     - Still contains some exclusions (war, inherent vice, etc.)
  
  3. **Named Perils Insurance**
     - Covers only specifically listed risks
     - Lower premiums than all-risk policies
     - Common perils include fire, collision, and sinking
     - Burden of proof is on the policyholder
  
  4. **Contingent Cargo Insurance**
     - Secondary coverage that applies when primary insurance fails
     - Protects against carrier insolvency or coverage denial
     - Important for high-value shipments with multiple carriers
  
  ## Assessing Your Insurance Needs
  
  ### Key Factors to Consider
  
  1. **Cargo Value and Type**

  4. **Rejection Insurance**
     - Covers losses when cargo is rejected by the receiver
     - Important for perishable or time-sensitive goods
     - May include return shipping costs
  
  ## Evaluating Insurance Providers
  
  ### Selection Criteria
  
  1. **Financial Stability**
     - Check ratings from A.M. Best, S&P, or Moody's
     - Verify licensing in relevant jurisdictions
     - Review company history and reputation
  
  2. **Claims Process**

  ## Cost-Effective Insurance Strategies
  
  1. **Consolidate Policies**
     - Annual policies for regular shippers
     - Blanket coverage vs. per-shipment declarations
     - Volume discounts and simplified administration
  
  2. **Adjust Deductibles**
     - Higher deductibles for lower premiums
     - Different deductibles based on cargo type or route
     - Aggregate deductibles for multiple shipments
  
  3. **Implement Risk Mitigation**
     - Improved packaging and container selection
     - Electronic tracking and monitoring systems
     - Carrier selection and route planning
  
  4. **Regular Policy Reviews**
     - Reassess coverage as shipping patterns change
     - Update valuations for market fluctuations
     - Evaluate new insurance products and providers
  
  ## Conclusion
  
  Selecting the right shipping insurance requires balancing comprehensive protection against cost considerations. By understanding your specific risks, identifying potential coverage gaps, and carefully evaluating insurance providers, you can develop an insurance strategy that effectively protects your cargo throughout its journey.
  
  Remember that the least expensive policy is rarely the best value. Focus instead on finding coverage that addresses your specific risks and provides reliable protection when you need it most.
